> It's only 1s and 0s, what can go wrong?

## The start
It all started in my teen years at my parents'. Since my childhood I always have had access to a computer, but when I turned 16, the computer being the same black box, and Windows 7 starting to get aggressive about upgrading to Windows 10, I figured *I could give it a try* (famous last words). My 1GB memory choked by opening the start menu and the old fans were ready to launch every time I opened MS Word. It had to change, and quickly.

After researching about it seeing a lot of "buy a new computer," "download more ram" and "stop being poor" stuff, I saw what seems to be my salvation: **Linux Mint**.

This beautiful thing, Windows-like but at the same time new and exciting! So, I did what any teenager would do on a Friday night, grabbed my family USB, installed this thing called LiLiUSB from what seemed as a fishy website, and start downloading this pass to my freedom with a `.iso` at the end. It took almost an hour, but the hype was bigger. *Am I bricking this thing? Is this my new me? Which F key should I spam? Will this penguin stop staring at me?* All these questions and excitement hit a brick wall when I saw this:

I was devastated, almost crying. *What was that thing?* whispered to myself again and again. I knew it had something to do with my F10 spamming and the red USB hanging from the front, so I did what once told, restart and pray. Lucky enough I saw the Windows logo. I called it.

But I was not over, I still suffered the same pains I had, but I convince myself *next time you are going to do it*. So, after a lot of YouTube, some toxic Reddit and a little help from my good old cousin, I had the confidence. So I did a backup (learned that it was important somehow), plugged in the red stick and got to the same infamous point, but this time my fingers flied through gray screens and blue text. The first time I saw the Mint desktop painting my old screen felt like a Turing-worth achievement! So, not knowing that I was doing but with the confidence of a teenager with the honorable objective of using his f-ing computer, I managed to install the thing, I put a sticky note on the monitor that said *Remember: the password is 1234* so my parents could at least see my beautiful Tux wallpaper.

The transition was harsh, my parents didn't like it, me neither at first; but with enough time I learned to like the chrome blue logo, I started to feel comfortable doing a little bit of `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, life was good. I even started to learn Cpp in senior year, finally my computer was cool! So I keep learning about this Cpp thing, wait, there is a C without the pp?, and a Java? This python thing is a pleasure to write! I like Linux!

But, on the last week of high school, after realizing I'm good at multiple-choice quizes and crushing the school quizes, I ended up on the nacionals of this quiz competition. I were on goddamn TV! Other kid endup winning, the guy was locked-in, I was vibing in a cool hotel with dad. The winning award was some scholarship for an Ivy League, but, to my surprise, the participation prize was a shiny brand-new 2016 Macbook Air! WHAT! I've heard about Macs before but looked impossible to get, so touching this well-cutted aluminum, this beautiful and just-enough clicking black keys, and enjoying a colorful screen made something click in my head. F Linux!

## University
So, after getting a good score on the Uni admission exam, I knew I had to do something with computers, I like them, they seems to like me, perfect! So I picked what seemed to be close, *Systems and computing Engineering*. Moving to a new city, first time living away from my parents, knowing new people, being present in this enourmus campus called UNAL, live was perfect! The first classes were easy but uncanny, I had a running loop of "really? Is this it?" in my head. It's not like differential equation were easy for me, nothing far from reality, but I couldn't care less, I wanted to program!

Luckily, at the same time, my good old cousing had a software company! I started to frecuent his office, and trying to grasp any knowlage I could. I remember the first home task he gave me as soon as I arrive: *"Do a login, do it using Java"*. It thought to myself *"hey, it's simple, I know Java and it's just a login, izzy pizzy"*. So I put my indexes on the old F & J and face the hard truth, I had no idea where to start. I spend a couple nights trying to even understand the request, I couldn't, this bricks of text just passed through my head. *Am I a failure? wasn't this my thing? What happened?* So I gave up and tell him *"I have 0 idea how to do it, please help"*.

He was benevolent enough to tell me *"Don't sweet it, let's get back to the basics"*. My excitement returned! `for`? easy. `class`, wait, can you do this? Awesome! I arrived to a point there I would do the f login using **JSX-RS**, Tomcat was my pet and Eclipse my home, I loved it. And then, he unleashed the real beast by accident on a sunny Saturday morning *"Hey, did you see they released a new version of Django yersterday?"*

What was this thing?! Is it like JSX-RS but for the beautiful python? What? I need to know more! So I spend that weekend flying through docs, trying new things, even finally taking jQuery seriously. I loved its templating, it looked beautiful. I can now create anything! Little did I know I was in what I later knew was called *Mount Stupidity*.

I started helping him with some teeny-tiny task for his main project, I also started learning about Angular and Django Rest Framework so I felt unbeatable. I would do a project per weekend, creating apps for literally anything, have a false feel of superiority with my schoolmates, even taking small freelance jobs that ended up being more than what he originally paid me (now, in retrospective, paying to learn to learn on a 4h/day 4days/week schedule, and incidentally helping you out with something simple every now and then, was not a great financial move). So I did what no one in their right mind would have done, I stormed out, slamming the door. I left just after I finished paying a spare company laptop I bought from him after the Macbook died. So I'm now 19, living completily alone in a student recidence, hating uni and with no real friends besides family, I won't really talk to anybody because I had a mission, to prove that I'm better than even Linus Torvals.
