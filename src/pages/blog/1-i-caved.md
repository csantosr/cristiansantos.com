A 10am huddle and an unused paycheck did the trick, I'd stop doing workaround shenanigans in favor of actual kernel shenanigans. My last two weeks have been complete chaos, but it's my chaos.

## So, I started to hate my Mac

Slowly, an uncomfortable feeling began to loop through my head. After my full-screen apps rearranged for the fifth time in an hour, I found myself swiping left and right, with three fingers&trade;, looking for iTerm while thinking *"Hey, this was waaay easier when I used to use i3, it was just Super-1 and I'd be right on my terminal"*.

I remembered how Primeagen flies through the apps like he's playing Chopin, how weird it was to have my WAN ip staring at me, like "don't use that __192.168__ tone with me, ok?". And that awful blue? Yeah, still awful. I also started thinking about DHH, the Omakub setup, it is nice-looking. But I had my great Apple wallpapers, the looks were covered. It had to be something else.

Aha! The problem was just the WM! I can fix it, it's impossible that, after all these years, no one has written a decent tiling window manager...  right? (Meanwhile, iTerm was still nowhere to be seen.)
